Great you were so brave to fight those many monsters!
You meet a sage lying at the foot of the caves waiting for someone to come one day and get the secret. He guides you to the tresure!
The sage goes on to say, 'Unfortunately the secret roll is present somewhere in the cave and I am having trouble traversing the caves.'
He adds, 'Seems like the ruler only wants to you to see what's inside the cave, but I know that there is a gate out there which might lead you to treasure named secret.txt.' Can you traverse pass that door somehow?
Not that easy! :P
